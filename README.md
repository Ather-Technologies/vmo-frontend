Hey everyone, not sure who will actually look at the repo or Readme but I wanted to thank you all for the interest in this project. I spent about 4 months on the rebuild after some major issues surfaced and reached a dead end with the project. I spend 10 months improving my React skills and getting married and in general having life happen to me. So now with a renewed hope for completion I've come back in full force, I want this damn thing online at whatever cost!

## TO:DO
Currently my priority is finishing the beta, getting the site actually functional archiving and playing live radio transmissions.

What needs done on the front end is a lot of refactoring of old (bad) code written when I was clueless on how the libraries worked. I've already made huge strides on state data structuring and I've changed router frameworks as well as separating the backend and frontend. This is why you can see the code here, my concern with making this open source was entirely security based. 

By separating UI from API I can mostly address the security fear so I can share actual progress reports. I have plans to maybe share commit messages from the private API repo but that is up in the air if it's worth spending the time to build a web app for that. I'm thinking about posting more up to date dev blogs to the vmo site at some point but I need to focus my efforts on the meat of the app. 

I definitely intend to add a change log during the production period and allowing people to voice their opinions on what features they want or changes they like. 

I will be adding dotation options and possibly a more feature rich subscription plan as this project is a time and money pit. I deliberated over the prospects of making this into a self sustaining project with a bank account and after enough convincing it would allow me to put more time and resources into hardware and development.

I will not add any advertisement in the near future, I find most Banner ad options to be extremely disruptive. I may start advertising local companies or events in the far future but at this point that is more than wishful thinking. 

Anyways have a great day and let me know if you have any suggestions!
